I have toyed around with Django in the past, and I genuinely thought it was pretty amazing.

There comes a time when I need to sit down and learn how to do something the correct way (the conventional, idiomatic way). This is where I'm at with Django, I know it reasonably well but I'll usually try to do things the wrong way.
